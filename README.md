# Arash's fork of evremap

After having had issues with the original implementation in the sense that the modifier key usage didn't work if one typed too fast, I decided to look into the bug and got interested in the code base. I decided to fork it to learn more about rust and solve the issue for myself. But since I changed the code too much I gave up on making it possible to merge back in.

Changes to the original repo:

* Restructured code base (modularity, unit tests, etc.)
* Removed DualRole

The original code is at: <https://github.com/wez/evremap>
